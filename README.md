# CareerPath
This project aims to guide its users' career paths. The user will enter their career choice in a query system, the algorithm will calculate a suitable career path based
on collected career data in its database. Each meaningful query has its unique score based algorithm in the backend side of the application. Frontend side will get this
response from the backend and display it to the user in a meaningful table-like format.

You can see the input screen with an example query below, this image also shows autocomplete algorithm, which autocompletes user inputs based on system data:
